            a ParisRadioHour is a set of ideas about music/crypto.
            <br />
            <br />
            each week, a new PRH is written on chain—by the community—and then auctioned off by the protocol
            <br />
            <br />
            auction proceeds enter the community's treasury, where they are used to further the PRH
            <br />
            <br />
            every PRH is created, issued, and auctioned permissionlessly. all data comes and goes directly from the solana blockchain
            <br />
            <br />

            p.s. community members can submit one post and one like per week. PRH is currently in beta on the solana devnet. try it <Link to="/">here</Link>
