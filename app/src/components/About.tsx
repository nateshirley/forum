            wallets that hold a membership can post once per session and like once per session.
            <br />
            <br />
            every session goes up for auction
            <br />
            <br />
            when a session expires, it's wrapped into an asset and transferred to the highest bidder
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            everything is on-chain. this process runs and restarts permissionlessly
